Full resting-state fMRI preprocessing pipeline performed using Nipype.
I followed the instructions on the following website (https://miykael.github.io/nipype_tutorial/notebooks/handson_preprocessing.html)
and used data downloaded from Openneuro. I ran Nipype using a 
Nipype docker container following these instructions (https://miykael.github.io/nipype_tutorial/notebooks/introduction_docker.html).
